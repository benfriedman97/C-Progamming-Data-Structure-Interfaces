stack_index_items: used for an "index items" stack with no duplicates, ignore-the-new item policy. 
This is a stack of positiveintegers and it keeps track of what's stored in the stack using an 
additional array in the stack ADT where each item in the stack also acts as an index in that array. 
For example, if the number 43 is added, it goes to the 43rd indexand checks if there is a 0 or 1 
stored there. If there is a 1, it ignores the current push operation so it doesn't store a duplicate. 
If there's a 0, it's added to the stack

stack_index_items_2: same as above, except it uses a forget-the-old policy so it
uses a doubly linked list for the stack and pointers to nodes for the array to check if it's present
instead of 0 or 1.

stack_array: uses an array for a stack, no duplicates, uses either ignore-new-item policy
or forget-the-old

stack_linked_list: uses a singly linked list for the stack, no duplicates, uses either ignore-the-new
item policy or forget-the-old
